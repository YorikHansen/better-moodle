### Pre-Commit

The `package.json` of Better-Moodle includes scripts for formatting (`prettier:write`) and linting (`lint:fix`), the Better-Moodle repository also includes an up-to-date release of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
Please run both scripts with yarn (`yarnÂ runÂ lint:fix` and `yarnÂ runÂ prettier:write`) before committing and also fix any warnings and issues reported by ESLint.
