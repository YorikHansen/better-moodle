## Development

### Contribution Workflow

Some steps are

1. clone
2. run `yarnÂ install`
3. develop and test. See sections [Bundling](#bundling) and [Testing](#testing)
4. run `yarnÂ runÂ lint:fix` and `yarnÂ runÂ prettier:write` to lint and format. See section [Pre-Commit](#pre-commit)
    1. fix any warnings and errors reported by ESLint
5. commit using [Conventional Commits][cc]. See section [Commit messages](#commit-messages) for more info.
6. Create a Pull-Request

### Bundling

In order to create a working userscript, the project needs to be bundled. If not existend, create a config for the target moodle instance in the `configs` folder.
Please see the `configs/_config.d.ts` file for reference on how configs need to be defined.

For bundling, simply run `yarn build <config>` where `<config>` is the name of your config file, without the `.json` file extension.
Afterwards you may copy the userscript into your clipboard to paste it into the editor of your userscript manager (On Linux systems using X11, this could for example be achieved by running `cat dist/better-moodle-<config>.user.js | xclip -selection c`).

If you want to lint and prettify the codebase before bundling, you can run `yarn ci <config>` instead.

### Testing

There currently are no automated tests available.
Please always make sure that Better-Moodle works on latest 3 to 4 versions of common browsers (Firefox and chromium based).
You may also want to test Better-Moodle on mobile devices if possible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bundling does not include transpiling or adding polyfills.
> When using new JavaScript / ECMAScript Features, consult [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) or the [MDN References](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).
> Features should be available in the latest devices and browser versions since minimum 6 months.
> This is not tested or checked automatically. It currently is the developers responsibility.

### Pre-Commit

The `package.json` of Better-Moodle includes scripts for formatting (`prettier:write`) and linting (`lint:fix`), the Better-Moodle repository also includes an up-to-date release of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
Please run both scripts with yarn (`yarnÂ runÂ lint:fix` and `yarnÂ runÂ prettier:write`) before committing and also fix any warnings and issues reported by ESLint.

> [!NOTE]
> It is planned to include CI scripts that automatically report ESLint Warnings and Errors.
> Pull Requests that produce ESLint Warnings and Errors or where prettier would produce changes to the codebase will then not be merged until these are resolved.
