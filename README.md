# better-moodle

This is a userscript to improve the design of [UzL Moodle](https://moodle.uni-luebeck.de/), as we don't like the new default design.

## Installation

1. Get yourself an up-to-date Userscript-Manager for your browser e.g. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Click [here][installation] to install the script.

## Update

Your Userscript-Manager _should_ regulary check for updates. You may always update manually by opening [installation link][installation].

## Features

### Darkmode

is not provided by this userscript. We recommend using the [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) browser extension.

### General and everywhere

-   modify the "Meine Kurse" link in navigation menu to be a dropdown for quick access to all personal non-hidden courses.
-   make pages use the full width of the screen and not only some few hundred pixels in the middle.

### Dashboard

-   move "Zeitleiste" and "Aktuelle Termine" into a **right** sidebar
-   add a **left** sidebar listing all personal non-hidden courses

### My Courses / "Meine Kurse"

-   increase boxes per row from 3 to 4 for desktop screens
